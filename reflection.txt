This project successfully demonstrates the complete integration of modern DevOps and deployment technologies by combining a static web application with containerization and automated orchestration. Through the use of Docker, the portfolio application becomes portable and consistent across multiple environments. Ansible further enhances the workflow by enabling automated image creation and container deployment across CentOS and Ubuntu virtual machines. Overall, the project shows how automation, containerization, and cross-platform deployment can streamline web application delivery and ensure reliable system performance.
